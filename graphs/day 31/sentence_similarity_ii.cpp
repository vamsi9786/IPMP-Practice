https://leetcode.com/problems/sentence-similarity-ii/description/

Given two sentences words1, words2 (each represented as an array of strings), and a list of similar word pairs pairs, determine if two sentences are similar.

For example, words1 = ["great", "acting", "skills"] and words2 = ["fine", "drama", "talent"] are similar, 
if the similar word pairs are pairs = [["great", "good"], ["fine", "good"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]].

Note that the similarity relation is transitive. For example, if “great” and “good” are similar, and “fine” and “good” are similar, 
then “great” and “fine” are similar.

Similarity is also symmetric. For example, “great” and “fine” being similar is the same as “fine” and “great” being similar.

Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = [] are similar, 
even though there are no specified similar word pairs.

Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like words1 = ["great"] 
can never be similar to words2 = ["doubleplus","good"].

Idea: use DSU

Algo: Step 1: Every unique word gets an integer id. ( unordered_map<string,int> id; )
      Step 2: Union all similar words.
      Step 3: Compare both sentences.
              For every position:
                        If words are equal==> continue;
                        Otherwise: Both words must exist in DSU. Their parents must be the same.
                        Otherwise (Parents are not same): false
      Step 4: return true;

Code:
class DSU {
public:
    vector<int> parent, sz;

    DSU(int n) {
        parent.resize(n);
        sz.assign(n, 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            parent[i] = i;
    }

    int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] == x)
            return x;

        return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
    }

    void unite(int u, int v) {
        u = find(u);
        v = find(v);

        if (u == v)
            return;

        if (sz[u] < sz[v])
            swap(u, v);

        parent[v] = u;
        sz[u] += sz[v];
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool areSentencesSimilarTwo(vector<string>& sentence1,
                                vector<string>& sentence2,
                                vector<vector<string>>& similarPairs) {

        if (sentence1.size() != sentence2.size())
            return false;

        unordered_map<string, int> id;
        int idx = 0;

        // Assign an ID to every unique word
        for (auto &p : similarPairs) {
            if (!id.count(p[0]))
                id[p[0]] = idx++;

            if (!id.count(p[1]))
                id[p[1]] = idx++;
        }

        DSU ds(idx);

        // Merge similar words
        for (auto &p : similarPairs) {
            ds.unite(id[p[0]], id[p[1]]);
        }

        // Compare sentences
        for (int i = 0; i < sentence1.size(); i++) {

            if (sentence1[i] == sentence2[i])
                continue;

            if (!id.count(sentence1[i]) || !id.count(sentence2[i]))
                return false;

            if (ds.find(id[sentence1[i]]) != ds.find(id[sentence2[i]]))
                return false;
        }

        return true;
    }
};
